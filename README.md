## Descripci√≥n

The wide diversity of products offered by the businesses allows attracting several different customer types and sell most of the crafted stock. However, these remaining items result as a problem because it takes up space and stalls the arrival of new collections. In our proposal we consider that the issue on hand can be resolved with an adequate forecasting prediction model(s) that considers the impact of the Inventory, Portfolio and Production variables. Being able to get the right forecasting model that avoids an excess of inventory and diminish storage costs to the company, while at the same time keeping enough product for customers to purchase.
 
To provide a consistent solution, we consider important to gather information that accurately represents the current and past stock movements and related sales distributions over time, in conjunction with the economical context and the unique industry appropriation of Furni Inv S.A.S. in relation to the whole industry. All to be able to correctly interrelate possible market movements and significant sale appropriation of the company to accomplish the desired goal.
